# AGENTS — evals
## Mission
Immutable proof workloads, hardware runner controller, WAN profiles, compatibility database, evidence tooling and benchmarks.

## Owned scope
test matrices, evidence schemas consumption, hardware/WAN runner, benchmark definitions, compatibility records

## Forbidden scope / special rules
Own immutable workloads/evidence/WAN/hardware/compatibility harness. Never alter benchmark acceptance to make a patch green; preserve seeds/raw evidence.

## Required reading
Root AGENTS, active phase, linked TDs/gates, architecture invariants, repository contract, relevant interfaces/boundary audits.

## Test obligations
Run all phase-required tests affecting this repo and any contract/version-skew/negative tests implied by changed boundaries. Hardware-dependent claims require hardware evidence.

## Cross-repo rules
Change another repo only when the phase permits it and use the cross-repo change template. Update canonical contracts first or atomically with compatible implementations.

## Proof/failure rules
Builder green => `INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_PENDING`. Fresh BREAKER required. Blocked tests remain blocked; no inferred success.
## Manual Verification Bridge v1
- `.steward/verification-policy.yaml` is the repository-local machine-readable verification policy until the central Project Steward assumes enforcement.
- Critical changes require a non-default branch and PR. The accepted default branch is the baseline unless canonical governance explicitly says otherwise.
- Builder, CI, fresh BREAKER, specialist, owner, merge gate and post-merge workflow authorities are distinct. Builders MUST NOT self-attest independent evidence or acceptance.
- Any material change to code, tests, requirements/invariants, schemas/migrations, workflows, executable scripts or relevant configuration invalidates prior review evidence by changing the Review-Subject-Digest.
- State model: `PLANNED → BUILDING → INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_PENDING → (BREAKER_FAILED | READY_FOR_OWNER_ACCEPTANCE) → ACCEPTED → MERGED → POST_MERGE_VERIFIED`, with `MERGE_VERIFICATION_FAILED` for failed merged-commit verification.
- Merge, rebase and conflict resolution are verification boundaries. Post-merge verification MUST target the actual merged commit.
- During this temporary bridge, manually checked independent/owner authority MUST be marked `MANUAL_AUTHORITY`; a `PASS` file or Builder-authored verdict is never independent evidence.
- Before push/merge, run `python scripts/verify_review_state.py --check` and the repository verification tests. Green Builder/CI results mean at most `INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_PENDING`.
